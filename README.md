# Reanimate

Reanimate is a library for programmatically generating animations with a twist towards
mathematics / 2D vector drawings. A lot of inspiration was drawn from 3b1b's manim library.

Reanimate aims at being a batteries-included way of gluing together different technologies: SVG as
a universal image format, LaTeX for typesetting, ffmpeg for video encoding, inkscape/imagemagick
for rasterization, potrace for vectorization, blender/povray for 3D graphics, and Haskell for
scripting.

In more practical terms, reanimate is a library for turning code like this:

```haskell
main = reanimate $ docEnv $ playThenReverseA $ mkAnimation duration $ \t ->
  partialSvg t $ pathify $ mkCircle radius
  where duration = 2; radius = screenHeight/3
```

... into animations like this:

# Prerequisites

Reanimate is built using the Haskell Tool Stack. For installation instructions, see: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

Optionally, you can install one or more of these programs to enable additional features:
 * [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), enables rendering animations to video files.
 * [latex](https://www.latex-project.org/), enables mathematical typesetting.
 * [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)/[imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), enables SVG->PNG convertions.
 * [potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/), enables PNG->SVG tracing.
 * [povray](https://www.povray.org/), enables raytracing.
 * [blender](https://www.blender.org/), enables 3D graphics.

I highly recommend that you install at least 'ffmpeg' and 'latex'.

# Installing / Running an example

Reanimate ships with a web-based viewer and automatic code reloading. To get a small demo
up and running, clone the repository, run one of the examples (this will install the library),
and wait for a browser window to open:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Lemmih/reanimate.git
$ cd reanimate/
$ stack build
$ stack ./examples/doc_drawCircle.hs
```

This should render the `doc_drawCircle` example in a new browser window. If you then change the
animation source code, the browser window will automatically reload and show the updated animation.
