Main run message:

  Reanimate has gone into daemon mode and will block until you hit
  ctrl-c. While Reanimate is in daemon mode, you can open a new
  console or terminal and execute your animation code again. It'll
  automatically send the new animation to the browser window.

  Linux users can pass --daemon to reanimate to run the process in
  the background. Windows users have to use PowerShell and explicitly
  fork the process:
    Start-Process -NoNewWindow ./reanimate_exe

  Connection to the browser window will be lost if you hit ctrl-c.


Executing with daemon:
  Send animation to daemon and exit.
Executing without daemon:
  Run daemon locally.
  Render animation once.
  Wait without exiting.
  Detach if given --daemon flag. Only for Linux.

Executing on Linux:
  Running 'main' will start the daemon if it isn't already running.
  Then it'll render the animation and send it to the daemon.
  The daemon will open a browser window.
  Daemon stops after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Executing on Windows:
  'main' will act as daemon and not return.
  Powershell command for running in the background:
    Start-Process -NoNewWindow ./reanimate_exe

  Subsequent runs will send animation to daemon and quit.

In GHCi:
  Start local daemon thread if necessary.
  :cmd reanimateLive
    1. wait for changes
    2. ":r"
    3. ":main"
    4. ":cmd Reanimate.reanimateLive"

Daemon port: 9162?

{-
  Improvements over previous infrastructure:
  - Multiple browser windows can be open.
  - Browser window won't get stuck trying to open a connection.
  - GHCi is robust and works with both cabal and stack.
  - Refreshing the code will re-open closed browser windows.
