Globes give a good sense of the shape and size of countries but also limit your
view to less than half the world at any one time.

If we unwrap a globe and lay it flat, the result is a projection that
preserves neither the shape or relative size of countries.

15s: unfolded

We can improve this by stretching the projection, giving true land sizes but
still distorting shapes.

25s: mercator

Mercator distorts everything and is, unfortunately, the projection used for
Google Maps.

30s: mollweide

Mollweide is a vast improvement over Mercator for most uses. Like Lambert,
it shows the true size of countries and continents at the cost of distorting
shapes. But this distortion is minimized by projecting on to an oval rather
than a rectangle.

50s: werner

Werner's projection is not in much use anymore but can be found in certain
historical documents from the 15 hundreds. Also, you never know when you'll need
a good heart-shaped map. Keep Werner in mind when wooing a carthographer.

65s: Collignon

Collignon might look strange but still manages to preserve relative sizes.

70s: Eckert

Eckert projections are some of my favorites. Each of Eckert's six projections
have a different trade-off between the accuracy of shapes and sizes, and I find
all of them to be visually pleasing.

85s: Fahey

Some people, not to be confused with flat-earthers, know that the world is round
and therefore a round projection is needed.

90s: Foucaut

Other projections may appear of little practical use but they often have
interesting mathematical properties that can be important, especially when comparing
smaller map segments.
